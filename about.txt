Running code
============
Begin your message with /run, followed by a syntax-highlighted code block. Note that highlight.js has an aliasing system, so for example "python" and "py" are interchangeable. Below is an example:
/run `窶義窶義py
print("hello world")
`窶義窶義
You can get a full list of supported languages (and aliases) with /langs.
