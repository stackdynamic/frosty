# Quickstart
Welcome to the Frosty user manual! 
To get a full list of available commands, use the < !list > command. 
To read the doc string of a command, call < !help [command] >.
The source to Frosty can be found pinned in #frosty. 
# Commands
Most commands are taken by Frosty in the form < !command_name *args >. Each user has an assigned access level: ``````asciidoc
banned :: restricted from use of virtually all commands.
user   :: standard access level, can perform commands that do not modify Frosty.
admin  :: is able to ban other users, give them admin status, and use otherwise restricted state-changing commands.
owner  :: ~~BDFL~~ stackdynamic.``````md

An example of a command is the < !ban > command, which unsurprisingly bans users, and is restricted to < admin+ > status. A call would look like this:``````CSS

> !ban [user]``````md

# Snowmen
If you need a snowman, the command syntax is a bit different. Use < give me a snowman > if you just want one snowman, or < give me [expression] snowmen > to have Frosty respond appropriately. For example, the following would give you 8 snowmen:``````CSS

> give me 2**3 snowmen``````md
Expression parsing is done via the < eval() > function. However, don't even think about injecting malicious code! Only parenthesis, numbers and arithmetic operators are allowed.```
