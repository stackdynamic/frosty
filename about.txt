# Channel Management
Users each have a role that acts as an id assigned to them. You can change the name of your role id with the /id command. Some examples of commands:
``````asciidoc
/add *users                 :: adds users (space separated role ids) to channel
/remove *users              :: removes users
/make channel_name (*users) :: makes new channel (users argument is optional)``````md
# Snowmen
If you need a snowman, the command syntax is a bit different. Use < give me a snowman > if you just want one snowman, or < give me [expression] snowmen > to have Frosty respond appropriately. For example, the following would give you 8 snowmen:``````CSS

> give me 2**3 snowmen``````md
Expression parsing is done via a secure docker sandbox.```
